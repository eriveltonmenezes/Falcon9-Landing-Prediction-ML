## 📘 Project Overview

This repository contains a **data science capstone project** focused on predicting whether the **first stage** of the *SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket* will **land successfully**.  
Since reusability of the first stage drastically reduces launch costs, predicting landing outcomes is crucial for **cost estimation** and **competitive bidding** in the aerospace industry.

> 💡 **Business Context:**  
> A Falcon 9 launch costs about **$62 million**, compared to more than **$165 million** for other providers.  
> If we can accurately predict landing success, we can estimate the cost structure and assist potential competitors in making informed bids.
